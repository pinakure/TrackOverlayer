<h4>A retroachievement user data tracker who likes overlays too much</h4>
This is a tool used to keep track of the user data like game progress, current game, global score, number of cheevos unlocked, etc.
After retrieving the data, it presents to the user a comprehensive list of cheevos corresponding to the game the user is actually playing
and allows him to choose an achievement to be 'the target'.
The tool will generate a custom overlay HTML file onto the different displayable elements will be inserted at their corresponding position,
all those details can be modified using CSS or tweaking them in the preferences menu.
